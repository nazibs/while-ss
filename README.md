# while-ss
A small-step interpreter for the WHILE language

This work is a part of the course homework for Programming Languages. The task is to create an interpreter for the While that allows while loop, if condition, AND and OR logical operators, less than comparator and basic mathematical operations of integers and boolean.


### Requirements:
1. Java 1.8


Following are the requirements of the homework assignment:
1. An Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of While.
2. A parser for While.
3. A small-step interpreter for this AST. A small-step interpreter does the minimum necessary amount of work to make progress, and returns the remaining AST, and the changed state.


Below is the flow and description of the Java code:
1. The program will take the input from the standard input and give the output result via standard output.
2. Lexer will go through the input string and tokenize it.
3. Parser will create the Abstract Syntax Tree based on the Grammar of the While.
4. Interpreter will evaluate the created AST and output the result.


### Features added:
Below are the additional features that I have added on top of the basic requirements:
1. There is no restriction of assuming exactly 1 whitespace between characters. The program will remove/ignore any number of whitespaces between each character.
2. The program also allows subtraction and division on top of the addition and multiplication. Although I haven't handled the special cases for the division like divide by 0. The program will return float when the division operand is involved in the input string.
3. The program also allows using greater comparator on top of the less than comparator


### References:
This work uses the previous work of While interepreter and logic for small step in the interpreter is added.
My work is mainly based on the tutorial 'Letâ€™s Build A Simple Interpreter' by Ruslan Spivak.
